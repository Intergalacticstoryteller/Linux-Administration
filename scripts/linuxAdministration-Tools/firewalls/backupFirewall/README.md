<h2>Backup Firewall Script Documentation</h2>


This script is used to backup your IP Table configurations. 

It creates a folder called “firewall” in your main machine’s directory and saves it there. That way it is out of the way but easily accessible. 
In order to run this script, you must have sudo privileges.

```sudo bash backupFirewall.sh```
 
You have two options: restore or backup your firewall. 
If you want to backup your current firewall configuration, type ```b```
If you want to restore your old firewall, type ```r```. 

You know the program has run successfully when there is no error message
